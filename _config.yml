# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a second-year graduate student in the division of [Pediatric Glioma Research](https://www.dkfz.de/en/pediatric-glioma-research). 
      I am interested in building models to predict tumorigenesis mechanisms. 
      I completed my Master's in Bioinformatics at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), 
      working on identifying relationships between human genetic ancestry and health in the Colombian population in the lab of 
      [King Jordan](https://jordan.biosci.gatech.edu/).
    
    <p>Previously, I have worked at [Sellers lab](https://sellerslab.org/) in [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) on identify genetic interactions from combinatorial CRISPR screens as well as a multitude of other projects.
      I received my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/).
